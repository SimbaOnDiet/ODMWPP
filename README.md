# An Opinion Dynamics Model Taking Peer Pressure Into Account


<b>This is the course work of Computation Physics A lectured by Prof. Ding</b>



ODMWPP（Opinion Dynamics Model With Peer Pressure）

Keywords: computational sociology, opinion dynamics, peer pressure

There is a report about this program in order to summit it as course work, however there is too much introduction and outcome analysis in it, hence I will just make a very brief description here without any loss of technical detail.

A more detailed account of my model: 

1. Construct a social network, to stimulate real social relation, I give each relationship a value to value the intimacy, and two person have high intimacy with the same person tend to have high intimacy, too. Groups are also produced, which contains people non-exclusively, and more the number of same groups two people belong to, more intimacy they tend to have. 
2. Give each people an initial pretended and real opinion, here I also introduce public media agent (Have one-way and low intimacy relationship with many people) and zealots(who keep sharing their real opinion and cling to it)
3. People share their real opinion with their intimate and share their pretended opinion with the less intimate and don't share with the rest
4. If a person receive a opinion different too much from his/her own real opinion, he might be even more support his initial choice and lower the intimacy of this relationship. The intimacy of a relationship can be increase otherwise. New relationship might be created, any some relationship might be broken. More intimate the friend who shares opinion with you, the more you are affected.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 multiple times, and check the outcome.
